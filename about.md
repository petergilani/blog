### More Information

My name is Peter Gilani, and I am currently a Senior Network Security Architect at Rackspace where I have worked in the Network Security Team since I joined at the start of 2010. My main focus for the last few years has been multicloud connectivity architecture.

Prior to Rackspace, I was a Pre-sales Networking Specialist and then a Service Desk Engineer for two other Cisco Partners.

I enrolled in the Cisco Networking Academy Program, while in college back in 2005, which covered the CCNA curriculum 2 evenings a week for 2 academic years and I attained the CCNA ceritification in early 2008. In 2009 I attained CCDA+CCNP and started teaching the CCNA curriculum at my Cisco Academy until 2012 and attained CCAI (Cisco Certified Academy Instructor). I attained CCSP in 2010 and in 2013 I passed the CCIE Security Written exam. I attained CCDP in 2016 and passed the CCIE R&S Written exam in 2019.

Recently this year in 2022, I have attained Aviatrix Certified Engineer Multi-Cloud Networking Associate and also their Multi-Cloud Networking Operations certification. I am currently working on Palo Alto PCNSA and plan to return to my Cisco studies after this.
