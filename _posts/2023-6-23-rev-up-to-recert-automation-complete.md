title: Rev Up to Recert - Network Automation  - Complete
---
Today I completed the [Understanding Cisco Network Automation Essentials (DEVNAE) learning path on Cisco U.](https://blog.petergilani.com/rev-up-to-recert-network-automation) as part of the latest Rev Up to Recert offering:

[![DEVNAE Complete Small]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/devnae-complete-small.jpg "DEVNAE Complete Small")](https://blog.petergilani.com/rev-up-to-recert-automation-complete/)

While I was able to skip through the majority of sections thanks to the pre-assessments, there was still a significant amount of material to cover which was split between videos, pages to read through and hands on labs.

Here is an overview of the curriculum:

Topics I needed to cover included Understanding YANG Models and Orchestrating Network Services with Cisco NSO - both of which provided great hands on labs where I got to play with:
- Cisco YANG Suite
  - Created a device profile for a CSR router
  - Retrieved YANG models, stored in repository and organized in YANG Sets
  - Expanded and observed ietf-interfaces module tree structure
  - Read filtered device config by building and running NETCONF RPC requests
  - Built and ran RPC to configure a new loopback interface on the router
- Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO)
  - Started NSO local instance on Linux VM and launched NSO CLI
  - Viewed device configuration data in different formats
  - Configured a device from NSO CLI
  - Verified device inventory and performed new device onboard
  - Configured device group and verified group membership
  - Configured multiple features on multiple devices at once
  - Synchronized device configurations from and to the network
  - Configured and applied device templates with variables
  - Troubleshoot NED to device communications
  - Created/compiled/deployed a service package and applied to multiple devices at once

This is all relevant to the [DevNet Expert Lab](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/devnet-expert-exam-topics-lab), and tops my CE credits up by 16 to a current total of 31, so is time well spent. Bring on the next Rev Up to Recert!
