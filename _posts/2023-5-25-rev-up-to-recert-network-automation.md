The title is 'Understanding Cisco Network Automation Essentials (DEVNAE 1.0)' which is classified as Intermediate level with just under 30 hours of content (almost double the previous [Rev Up to Recert: Python course](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/learning-plan-detail-standard?ltui__urlRecordId=a1c6e00000AUqSGAA1&ltui__urlRedirect=learning-plan-detail-standard&ccid=revup-to-recert&dtid=email&oid=revup-to-recert-python)) with only 1 additional CE (Continuing Education) credit:
