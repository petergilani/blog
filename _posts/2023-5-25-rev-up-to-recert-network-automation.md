<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"> Thinking it's about time to share the details of the next Rev Up to Recert round... anyone interested in that? </p>&mdash; Matt Saunders (@citylifematt) <a href="https://twitter.com/citylifematt/status/1659226231215104000">May 18, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I will be updating this post with additional info as and when time permits.
