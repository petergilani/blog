title: Rev Up to Recert - Network Automation and Cisco U.
---

The new [Network Automation](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/question/0D56e0000CytbYNCQY/rev-up-to-recert-network-automation-and-cisco-u) learning path was announced yesterday:

This was one week following the initial teaser from Cisco's Lead Community Manager, Matt Saunders:

It is available on the new Cisco U. learning platform:

The title is 'Understanding Cisco Network Automation Essentials (DEVNAE 1.0)' which is classified as Intermediate level with just under 30 hours of content (almost double the previous [Rev Up to Recert: Python course](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/learning-plan-detail-standard?ltui__urlRecordId=a1c6e00000AUqSGAA1&ltui__urlRedirect=learning-plan-detail-standard&ccid=revup-to-recert&dtid=email&oid=revup-to-recert-python)) with only 1 additional (16) CE (Continuing Education) credits:

One big improvement over the last Rev Up to Recert round is 'Pre-Assessments', which allow you to demonstrate proficiency and then skip modules accordingly.

18 multiple choice questions later (I scored 17/18) for Network Automation Fundamentals and nearly 1/3 of the whole learning path is already complete!

At this rate, this should end up taking up less time than the Python round, while providing a valuable refresher on any stale topics since my DEVCOR pass 3 months ago.

This all helps towards my current primary goal (DevNet Expert), so overall I am delighted with this round of Rev Up to Recert - the DevNet focus is great and the delivery with Cisco U. and pre-assessments make this an effective use of students' time regardless of their familiarity with the learning path.

I will update this post with additional info as and when time permits.
