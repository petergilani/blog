## Press releases

One feature to keep an eye on is [FaceTime for tvOS](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/06/tvos-17-brings-facetime-and-video-conferencing-to-apple-tv-4k/), which I see becoming the new default for calls with family and close friends.

New privacy and security features were also [announced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/apple-announces-powerful-new-privacy-and-security-features/) (further info [here](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10053/)) in addition to the [good news](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/06/apple-provides-powerful-insights-into-new-areas-of-health/) the health app is finally coming to iPad.

After nearly 2 weeks hands on, the experience so far is very positive with more things fixed than broken.
