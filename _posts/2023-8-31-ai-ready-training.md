Today I completed the two courses required for the AI-Ready Rackspace Credly [badge](https://www.credly.com/org/rackspace-technology/badge/ai-ready):

- [Artificial Intelligence and Business Strategy](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/artificial-intelligence-and-business-strategy/) (1h 26m)
- [Generative AI for Business Leaders](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/generative-ai-for-business-leaders/) (55m 56s)

One new concept for me which I liked is the 'ditial twin', which has similarities to network labbing, where a real world system is virtualised.

I've heavily relied on regular virtualised labbing for the last ~7 years, in order to validate new network designs/modifications/migrations, to great levels of detail, where I simulate the same topology/platoforms/code versions/features etc. However, it had not occured to me before that the same could be done for a car manufacturing process for [example](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/03/mercedes-to-use-nvidias-digital-twin-tech-to-modernize-its-factories/), where instead of network devices, a factory, machines and workers are virtualised.

There are elements of the digital twin, which I think could enhance network labbing, such as real-time monitoring of the real system being represented, which is something I plan to explore in a future post.
