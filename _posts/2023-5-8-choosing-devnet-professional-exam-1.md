title: Choosing a DevNet Professional Exam - Part 1
---

Since passing the DEVCOR 350-901, I can take one of the following to complete the DevNet Professional certification:

* **[300-435 ENAUTO](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/exams/current-list/enauto-300-435.html)**
* [300-835 CLAUTO](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/exams/current-list/clauto-300-835.html)
* **[300-635 DCAUTO](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/exams/current-list/dcauto-300-635.html)**
* **[300-535 SPAUTO](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/exams/current-list/spauto-300-535.html)**
* [300-735 SAUTO](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/exams/current-list/sauto-300-735.html)
* [300-910 DEVOPS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/exams/current-list/devops-300-910.html) 
* [300-915 DEVIOT](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/exams/current-list/deviot-300-915.html) 
* [300-920 DEVWBX](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/exams/current-list/devwbx-300-920.html)

I want to pick the exam which most closely aligns with the DevNet Expert lab, which I have so far narrowed down to ENAUTO, DCAUTO and SPAUTO.

I will update with more info in part 2.
